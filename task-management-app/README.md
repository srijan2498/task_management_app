The Task Management App is a simple task manager built with React and Next.js. The app allows users to:

Add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed.
Sort tasks dynamically by priority (high, medium, low).
Search tasks by title or description.
Persist tasks using local storage.
Server-side rendering (SSR) is used for initial task loading.
The app is responsive and color-coded based on task priority:

High Priority: Red (1)
Medium Priority: Yellow (2)
Low Priority: Green (3)
